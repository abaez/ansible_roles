# ansible-roles
## set of roles by [Alejandro Baez](https://twitter.com/a_baez)

### DESCRIPTION
A stack of roles I tend to use on my ansible builds. Didn't want to keep
copying and pasting roles or having entire separate repositories for each role.
So I'm trying to keep them all here and then modifying according to the
playbook's requirements.
